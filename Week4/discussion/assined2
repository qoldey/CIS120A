Do you think sdudying number bases is important? Why or why not? Which bases (if any) do you think it is important to know and understand? Why?


In general, I do not think I entirely see the purpose in studying various number bases. I feel learning about binary may be the most important base to study due to it's immense real world application, followed by hexadecimal, but I do not find these neccassary. I also believe understanding how to convert to various bases and their importance could may also be helpful when developing software.
