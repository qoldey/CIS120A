Java method syntax makes sense to me for the most part. I don't entirely understand the purpose of static methods, but I am sure it will come with time.
I am a fan of languages with C-based syntax. C was the first language I began to learn and this style makes sense so far in my opinion.

I think I prefer C's .h header files approach for now opposed to Java's public methods and packages, but I am also unsure if I am fully utilizing the features.


Hey Vedant,

I also enjoy the simplicity scripting languages provide, Bash is my personal favorite. When using scripting languages, I still try to seperate my code into modules as much as possiible, I know functions with parameters and returns are still possible in languages like Bash and Python. I actually prefer manually keeping track of variable types in Java because I feel like it makes the program easier to read.

Thanks!
